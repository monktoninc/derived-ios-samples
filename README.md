Please visit our website https://monkton.io/derived for more information on Derived and DerivedKit and what it does.

## Getting started with Derived iOS Samples 

Clone the derived-ios-samples repository. You will need to update the bundle identifier for the app to an internal bundle identifier for your organization. Configure code signing (Automatic and select your organization).

If the DerivedKit SDK is installed the app will compile and can be run on your device.
